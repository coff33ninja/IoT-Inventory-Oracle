# Quick Start Guide

Get productive with IoT Inventory Oracle in just 10 minutes! This guide walks you through the essential features to get you started.

## Your First 10 Minutes

### 1. Add Your First Component (2 minutes)

1. **Click the `+` button** in the top-right corner
2. **Add a component** you actually own:
   ```
   Name: Arduino Uno R3
   Quantity: 1
   Location: Electronics Box
   Status: I Have
   ```
3. **Let AI help**: Click "AI Enhance" to auto-generate description and category

### 2. Chat with the AI Assistant (3 minutes)

1. **Open the chat** (chat icon in the sidebar)
2. **Try these commands**:
   ```
   "I just bought an ESP32 from Amazon for $15"
   "What projects can I build with an Arduino?"
   "I need components for a temperature sensor project"
   ```
3. **Watch the magic**: AI automatically adds components and suggests projects!

### 3. Create Your First Project (3 minutes)

1. **Go to Projects tab**
2. **Click "Create New Project"** or let AI suggest one
3. **Try AI Kickstart**: 
   - Select a project
   - Click "AI Kickstart"
   - Get complete build instructions and code!

### 4. Explore Smart Features (2 minutes)

1. **Component Relationships**: Say "ESP12E with NodeMCU shield" - watch AI create separate linked components
2. **Status Management**: Components automatically move between "I Have", "I Need", "I Want"
3. **Search Everything**: Use the search bar to find components across your entire inventory

## Essential Features Overview

### ü§ñ AI Assistant

- **Smart Suggestions**: Get project ideas based on your inventory
- **Code Generation**: Complete Arduino/ESP32 code with explanations

### üì¶ Inventory Management
- **7 Status Categories**: I Have, I Need, I Want, I Salvaged, I Returned, Discarded, Given Away
- **40+ Categories**: Electronics, computer components, tools, general items
- **Purchase Tracking**: Serial numbers, purchase dates, suppliers, warranties
- **Component Relationships**: Link related components (CPU + motherboard)

### üéØ Project Management
- **3-Stage Workflow**: Planning ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed
- **AI-Generated Instructions**: Step-by-step guides with code
- **Component Allocation**: Track which components are used where
- **Sub-Projects**: Break complex projects into phases

## Quick Tips for Success

### üí° Pro Tips
1. **Talk to the AI naturally**: "I bought 5 LEDs yesterday" works better than formal commands
2. **Use the CLI for bulk operations**: `npm run cli inventory list "I Have"`
3. **Let AI categorize**: Don't manually categorize - AI does it better
4. **Enable auto-population**: Keep it on for the best experience

- **Chat History**: Right sidebar shows all conversations
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Click chevron for more workspace
- **Bulk Import**: Use CLI to import from spreadsheets

## Common First-Time Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I have a box of random components"
```
Chat: "I have an Arduino, some LEDs, resistors, and a breadboard"
Result: AI creates inventory items and suggests beginner projects
```

### Scenario 2: "I want to build a weather station"
```
Chat: "Help me plan a weather station project"
Result: AI creates project with component list and build instructions
```

### Scenario 3: "I just received my Amazon order"
```
Chat: "I got 3 ESP32s, 10 sensors, and a power supply from Amazon for $45"
Result: AI adds everything with purchase details and supplier info
```
