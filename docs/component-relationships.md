# Component Relationships Guide

Master the smart component relationship system that automatically links related components and creates logical bundles for better inventory organization.

## Overview

The component relationship system provides:
- **Smart Recognition**: AI automatically identifies related components
- **5 Relationship Types**: requires, compatible_with, enhances, part_of, contains
- **Component Bundles**: Group related items into logical kits and systems
- **Automatic Linking**: Create separate but connected inventory entries
- **Compatibility Tracking**: Monitor component compatibility for projects

## Relationship Types

### 1. Requires Relationship

**Definition**: Component A needs Component B to function properly

**Examples:**
- ESP12E Wi-Fi Module **requires** NodeMCU Development Shield
- Intel CPU **requires** Compatible Motherboard (LGA1700 socket)
- Raspberry Pi **requires** MicroSD Card for operation

**AI Recognition:**
```
"ESP12E with NodeMCU HW-389 shield"
→ Creates: ESP12E (requires) NodeMCU HW-389
```

### 2. Compatible_With Relationship

**Definition**: Components work well together but aren't strictly required

**Examples:**
- Arduino Uno **compatible_with** Sensor Shield V5.0
- RTX 4070 Graphics Card **compatible_with** 850W Power Supply
- ESP32 **compatible_with** Various Sensor Modules

**AI Recognition:**
```
"This sensor works great with ESP32 boards"
→ Creates: Sensor (compatible_with) ESP32
```

### 3. Enhances Relationship

**Definition**: Component B improves or extends Component A's capabilities

**Examples:**
- RGB LED Strip **enhances** Basic LED Controller
- High-Speed RAM **enhances** Gaming PC Performance
- External Antenna **enhances** Wi-Fi Module Range

**AI Recognition:**
```
"Added external antenna to improve ESP32 range"
→ Creates: External Antenna (enhances) ESP32
```

### 4. Part_Of Relationship

**Definition**: Component A is a physical part of Component B

**Examples:**
- CPU Cooler **part_of** Complete PC Build
- Sensor Module **part_of** Weather Station Kit
- Power Connector **part_of** Development Board

**AI Recognition:**
```
"The kit includes a temperature sensor as part of the weather station"
→ Creates: Temperature Sensor (part_of) Weather Station Kit
```

### 5. Contains Relationship

**Definition**: Component A physically contains Component B

**Examples:**
- Starter Kit **contains** Individual Components
- Project Enclosure **contains** Circuit Board
- Tool Box **contains** Various Tools

**AI Recognition:**
```
"My Arduino kit contains LEDs, resistors, and jumper wires"
→ Creates: Arduino Kit (contains) LEDs, Resistors, Jumper Wires
```

## Automatic Relationship Detection

### AI Recognition Patterns

**Electronics Examples:**
```
Input: "ESP12E with NodeMCU HW-389 Ver1.0"
Output: 
├── ESP12E Wi-Fi Module (Microcontroller)
├── NodeMCU HW-389 Ver1.0 Shield (Development Board)
└── Relationship: ESP12E requires NodeMCU Shield
```

**Computer Component Examples:**
```
Input: "Intel i7-12700K with ASUS Z690 motherboard"
Output:
├── Intel Core i7-12700K (CPU/Processor)
├── ASUS Z690-A Gaming WiFi (Motherboard)
└── Relationship: CPU compatible_with Motherboard (LGA1700)
```

**Kit Examples:**
```
Input: "Arduino starter kit with breadboard and components"
Output:
├── Arduino Starter Kit (Bundle)
├── Arduino Uno (Development Board)
├── Breadboard (Breadboard/PCB)
├── Jumper Wires (Cable/Wire)
└── Relationships: Kit contains all components
```

### Trigger Phrases

**Relationship Triggers:**
- "with", "and", "plus", "including"
- "requires", "needs", "must have"
- "compatible with", "works with"
- "enhances", "improves", "boosts"
- "part of", "included in", "component of"

**Examples:**
```
"ESP32 with OLED display" → compatible_with
"CPU requires compatible motherboard" → requires
"This antenna enhances Wi-Fi range" → enhances
"Sensor is part of the weather kit" → part_of
"Kit contains various components" → contains
```

## Component Bundles

### Bundle Types

**Kit Bundles:**

**System Bundles:**
- Complete functional systems
- Integrated solutions
- Multi-component assemblies
- End-to-end setups

### Creating Bundles

**AI Bundle Creation:**
```
Input: "I have a complete PC gaming setup"
AI Creates:
├── Gaming PC System Bundle
├── Intel i7 CPU
├── RTX 4070 GPU
├── 32GB DDR4 RAM
├── 1TB NVMe SSD
├── Gaming Monitor
├── Mechanical Keyboard
└── Gaming Mouse
```

**Manual Bundle Creation:**

3. Choose bundle type (Kit/Combo/System)
4. Name the bundle
5. Add description and notes

### Bundle Management

**Bundle Operations:**
- Add/remove components from bundles
- Update bundle information and descriptions
- Dissolve bundles while keeping components
- Create sub-bundles for complex systems

**Bundle Hierarchy:**
```
Gaming Setup (System)
├── PC Components (Kit)
│   ├── CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage
│   └── Motherboard, PSU, Case
├── Peripherals (Combo)
│   ├── Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse
│   └── Headset, Webcam
└── Accessories (Kit)
    ├── Cables, Adapters
    └── Cleaning supplies
```

## Smart Component Recognition

### Compound Component Detection

**AI Intelligence:**
The AI recognizes when users mention compound components and automatically creates separate but linked entries:

**Electronics:**
```
"ESP12E with NodeMCU HW-389" 
→ Separate: ESP12E module + NodeMCU shield + relationship

"Arduino with sensor shield"
→ Separate: Arduino board + sensor shield + relationship

"Raspberry Pi starter kit"
→ Bundle: Pi + accessories with relationships
```

**Computer Components:**
```
"Gaming PC build with RTX 4070"
→ Bundle: Complete PC with all components + relationships

"Intel i7 with compatible motherboard"
→ Separate: CPU + motherboard + compatibility relationship

"32GB RAM kit (2x16GB)"
→ Single item with configuration notes
```

### Compatibility Analysis

**Automatic Compatibility Checking:**
- CPU socket compatibility with motherboards
- RAM compatibility with motherboards and CPUs
- Power supply wattage for GPU requirements
- Physical size constraints (GPU length, CPU cooler height)

**Compatibility Warnings:**
```
Warning: Intel CPU (LGA1700) not compatible with AMD motherboard (AM4)
Suggestion: Use Intel Z690/Z790 motherboard instead
```

**Compatibility Suggestions:**
```
Suggestion: RTX 4070 pairs well with:
├── 650W+ Power Supply
├── PCIe 4.0 compatible motherboard
├── 16GB+ DDR4/DDR5 RAM
└── High refresh rate monitor
```
