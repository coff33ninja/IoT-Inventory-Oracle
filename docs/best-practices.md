    They arrived yesterday and are in perfect condition."

❌ "I got some microcontrollers"
```

**Provide Context:**
```
✅ "I need components for my smart home temperature monitoring project. 
    I want to monitor 4 rooms with wireless sensors."

❌ "I need some sensors"
```

**Include Purchase Details:**
```
✅ "Ordered 10 DHT22 sensors from Adafruit for $89.50. 
    Order #12345, should arrive next week."

❌ "Ordered some temperature sensors"
```

### Auto-Population Best Practices

**Enable Auto-Population:**
- Keep auto-population enabled for best experience
- Review suggestions before they're applied
- Correct the AI when it makes mistakes

**Provide Feedback:**
- Tell the AI when it gets something wrong
- Confirm when suggestions are correct
- Help train the AI with your preferences

**Use Natural Language:**
```
✅ "My ESP32 stopped working, it's completely dead"
✅ "I returned the faulty sensor to Amazon"
✅ "Just received my Adafruit order with 3 sensors"

❌ "Update item status to discarded"
❌ "Change inventory status returned"
❌ "Add new item received"
```
