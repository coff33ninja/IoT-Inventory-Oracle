# Inventory Management Guide

Master the comprehensive inventory system that tracks everything from electronics components to computer hardware, tools, and general items.

## Overview

The inventory system supports:
- **40+ Categories**: Electronics, computer components, tools, furniture, software
- **7 Status Types**: I Have, I Need, I Want, I Salvaged, I Returned, Discarded, Given Away
- **Purchase Tracking**: Serial numbers, suppliers, warranties, prices
- **Component Relationships**: Link related components that work together
- **Smart Search**: Find items across all categories and projects

## Status System

### Core Statuses

**🟢 I Have** - Components you currently own
- Items you can use in projects immediately
- Allocated quantities tracked separately
- Available for project allocation

**🔴 I Need** - Essential components for current projects
- Required to complete active projects
- High priority for purchasing
- Often auto-generated by AI project analysis

**🟡 I Want** - Nice-to-have components for future projects
- Wishlist items for future builds
- Enhancement components
- Components for planned projects

### Lifecycle Statuses

**🔵 I Salvaged** - Components recovered from old projects
- Reusable parts from disassembled projects
- May need testing before use
- Often have history notes

**🟠 I Returned** - Components sent back to suppliers
- Defective items returned for refund/replacement
- Warranty claims processed
- Tracking return status

**⚫ Discarded** - Components no longer usable
- Broken or damaged beyond repair
- End-of-life components
- Properly disposed items

**🟣 Given Away** - Components donated or given to others
- Items shared with community
- Gifts to other makers
- Educational donations
