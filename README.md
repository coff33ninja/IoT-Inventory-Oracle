### Data Flow
1. **React App** ‚Üí API calls ‚Üí **Express Server** ‚Üí **Database/Files**
2. **CLI Tools** ‚Üí Direct access ‚Üí **Database/Files**
3. **Fallback**: localStorage when server unavailable

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Interface (CLI)

The application includes powerful CLI tools for direct database management and advanced operations. These tools provide direct access to the SQLite database and markdown files:

### Inventory Management

```bash
# List all inventory items
npm run cli inventory list

# List items by status
npm run cli inventory list "I Have"
npm run cli inventory list "I Want"
npm run cli inventory list "I Need"

# List items by category
npm run cli inventory list "Sensors"
npm run cli inventory list "Core"

# Add new inventory item
npm run cli inventory add <name> <quantity> <location> <status> [category] [description]
# Example:
npm run cli inventory add "ESP32-DevKit" 3 "Electronics-Box" "I Have" "Microcontrollers"

# Search inventory
npm run cli inventory search <query>
# Example:
npm run cli inventory search "ESP32"

# Show inventory statistics
npm run cli inventory stats
```

### Project Management

```bash
# List all projects
npm run cli projects list

# List projects by status
npm run cli projects list "In Progress"
npm run cli projects list "Completed"

# Show detailed project information
npm run cli projects show <project-id>

# Search projects
npm run cli projects search <query>
# Example:
npm run cli projects search "temperature"

# Show project statistics
npm run cli projects stats
```

### Global Operations

```bash
# Search across both inventory and projects
npm run cli search <query>
# Example:
npm run cli search "ESP32"

# Show comprehensive statistics
npm run cli stats
```

### CLI Examples

```bash
# Quick inventory check
npm run cli inventory list "I Have"

# Find all sensor-related items
npm run cli search "sensor"

# Check project status
npm run cli projects list "In Progress"

# Get overview of everything
npm run cli stats

# Add a new component
npm run cli inventory add "Arduino-Nano" 2 "Dev-Board-Box" "I Have" "Microcontrollers"

# Search for specific projects
npm run cli projects search "LED"

# View detailed project info
npm run cli projects show "2025-10-11T23:45:25.501Z"
```

### CLI Tips

- **Status Values**: Use exact status names: "I Have", "I Want", "I Need", "I Salvaged", "I Returned", "Discarded", "Given Away"
- **Quotes**: Use quotes around multi-word arguments: `"I Have"`, `"Test Component"`
- **Project IDs**: Use the full project ID from the list command for detailed views
- **Search**: Search works across names, descriptions, categories, and project components
