## üóÑÔ∏è Storage Architecture

The application uses a modern client-server architecture:

### Server-Side Storage
- **Database**: `inventory.db` (SQLite database) for inventory data
- **Projects**: `projects/` directory with Markdown files
- **Features**: ACID transactions, indexed queries, file-based documentation
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for all data operations

### Client-Side (React App)
- **API Client**: Communicates with server via HTTP requests
- **State Management**: React context with local state
- **Fallback**: localStorage backup when server is unavailable
- **Real-time**: Immediate UI updates with server synchronization

### Data Flow
1. **React App** ‚Üí API calls ‚Üí **Express Server** ‚Üí **Database/Files**
2. **CLI Tools** ‚Üí Direct access ‚Üí **Database/Files**
3. **Fallback**: localStorage when server unavailable

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Line Interface (CLI)

The application includes powerful CLI tools for direct database management and advanced operations. These tools provide direct access to the SQLite database and markdown files:

### Inventory Management

```bash
# List all inventory items
npm run cli inventory list

# List items by status
npm run cli inventory list "I Have"
npm run cli inventory list "I Want"
npm run cli inventory list "I Need"

# List items by category
npm run cli inventory list "Sensors"
npm run cli inventory list "Core"

# Add new inventory item
npm run cli inventory add <name> <quantity> <location> <status> [category] [description]
# Example:
npm run cli inventory add "ESP32-DevKit" 3 "Electronics-Box" "I Have" "Microcontrollers"

# Search inventory
npm run cli inventory search <query>
# Example:
npm run cli inventory search "ESP32"

# Show inventory statistics
npm run cli inventory stats
```

### Project Management

```bash
# List all projects
npm run cli projects list

# List projects by status
npm run cli projects list "In Progress"
npm run cli projects list "Completed"

# Show detailed project information
npm run cli projects show <project-id>

# Search projects
npm run cli projects search <query>
# Example:
npm run cli projects search "temperature"

# Show project statistics
npm run cli projects stats
```

### Global Operations

```bash
# Search across both inventory and projects
npm run cli search <query>
# Example:
npm run cli search "ESP32"

# Show comprehensive statistics
npm run cli stats
```

### CLI Examples

```bash
# Quick inventory check
npm run cli inventory list "I Have"

# Find all sensor-related items
npm run cli search "sensor"

# Check project status
npm run cli projects list "In Progress"

# Get overview of everything
npm run cli stats

# Add a new component
npm run cli inventory add "Arduino-Nano" 2 "Dev-Board-Box" "I Have" "Microcontrollers"

# Search for specific projects
npm run cli projects search "LED"

# View detailed project info
npm run cli projects show "2025-10-11T23:45:25.501Z"
```

### CLI Tips

- **Status Values**: Use exact status names: "I Have", "I Want", "I Need", "I Salvaged", "I Returned", "Discarded", "Given Away"
- **Quotes**: Use quotes around multi-word arguments: `"I Have"`, `"Test Component"`
- **Project IDs**: Use the full project ID from the list command for detailed views
- **Search**: Search works across names, descriptions, categories, and project components

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher) and **npm** or **yarn**
2. **Modern web browser** with ES Modules support
3. **Google Gemini API Key** - Get yours at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd iot-inventory-oracle
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your Gemini API key
   # Replace 'your_gemini_api_key_here' with your actual API key
   ```

4. **Start both server and client**
   ```bash
   # Start both API server and React app
   npm run dev:full
   
   # Or start them separately:
   npm run server  # API server on http://localhost:3001
   npm run dev     # React app on http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Architecture
- **API Server**: `http://localhost:3001` - Handles database operations
- **React App**: `http://localhost:3000` - User interface
- **CLI Tools**: Direct database access for advanced operations

### Environment Configuration

The app uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Required: Google Gemini API Key
VITE_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: Home Assistant integration (can also be set via Settings UI)
VITE_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://your-home-assistant-ip:8123
VITE_HOME_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token_here
```

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` for protection
- Keep your API keys secure and rotate them regularly
- Use different API keys for development and production

### Getting Your Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated key to your `.env` file

### Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

2. **Set environment variables** in your hosting platform
3. **Deploy the `dist` folder** to your web server

Popular deployment options:
- **Vercel**: Automatic deployments with environment variable support
- **Netlify**: Easy static site hosting with build integration
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for public repositories
- **Self-hosted**: Any web server that can serve static files

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Inventory View**:
    *   Click the **`+`** button to add a new component. Use the AI features in the modal to auto-generate descriptions and suggest categories.
    *   Click on any item in the table to open the **Component Detail Modal**, which provides AI-powered insights and market data.
    *   Use the tabs (`I Have`, `I Want`, `I Need`, etc.) to filter your view.
    *   To start a project, select checkboxes next to items in the "I Have" tab and click the **"Checkout"** button.

2.  **Projects View**:
    *   Here you'll find all the projects you've created.
    *   **Link GitHub Repo**: Click this to associate a project with a public GitHub repository. The AI can then sync the required components.
    *   **AI Kickstart**: Click this to send the project's component list to the chat assistant, asking for a detailed plan, code, and guidance.

3.  **Home Assistant View**:
    *   First, go to **Settings** and enter your Home Assistant URL and a Long-Lived Access Token.
    *   Once configured, this view will populate with all your HA entities.
    *   Click **"Link to Inventory"** on any entity card to associate it with a specific component from your stock.

4.  **Chat Assistant**:
    *   The heart of the application. Ask it anything!
    *   Examples:
        *   _"What can I build with an ESP32 and a BME280 sensor?"_
        *   _"Find me a supplier for a Raspberry Pi 5."_
        *   _"Write me a simple MicroPython script to read a DHT22 sensor."_
        *   _"I'm starting a new project to monitor my 3D printer. What components will I need?"_

5.  **Settings**:
    *   Configure your Home Assistant connection.
    *   Use the **Import/Export** functions to manage your inventory data.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"VITE_API_KEY environment variable not set" Error**
- Ensure you've created a `.env` file in the root directory
- Verify your API key is correctly set as `VITE_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- Restart the development server after adding environment variables

**AI Chat Not Working**
- Check that your Gemini API key is valid and has quota remaining
- Verify the API key has the necessary permissions for the Gemini API
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

**Home Assistant Integration Issues**
- Ensure your Home Assistant URL is accessible from your browser
- Verify your Long-Lived Access Token has the required permissions
- Check that CORS is properly configured in Home Assistant if needed

**Development Server Won't Start**
- Ensure Node.js version is 16 or higher: `node --version`
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check for port conflicts (default is 3000)

### Getting Help

- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify all environment variables are properly set
- Ensure your API keys are valid and have sufficient quota
- Try clearing browser cache and localStorage
