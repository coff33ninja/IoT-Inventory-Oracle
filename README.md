*   **AI**: [Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)](https://ai.google.dev/docs)
*   **Core Libraries**: No bundler! The app uses modern browser features like **ES Modules** and **Import Maps** for a fast, buildless development experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Running the App

This project is designed to run directly in a modern web browser without a complex build step.

### Prerequisites

1.  A modern web browser that supports ES Modules and Import Maps (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2.  A Google Gemini API Key.

### Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. It is designed to be loaded from a `process.env.API_KEY` environment variable.

For local development or deployment, you need to ensure this variable is available to the application. One common way to do this with a static server is to replace the placeholder at serve time or use a service that allows setting environment variables.

For a quick local test, you could temporarily modify `services/geminiService.ts` (this is **not** recommended for production):

```typescript
// In services/geminiService.ts - FOR LOCAL TESTING ONLY
// Replace this:
if (!process.env.API_KEY) {
  throw new Error("API_KEY environment variable not set");
}
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });

// With this:
const YOUR_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";
if (!YOUR_API_KEY) {
  throw new Error("API_KEY not set");
}
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY });
```

### Running

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. A local web server is recommended to avoid potential issues with file pathing.

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Inventory View**:
    *   Click the **`+`** button to add a new component. Use the AI features in the modal to auto-generate descriptions and suggest categories.
    *   Click on any item in the table to open the **Component Detail Modal**, which provides AI-powered insights and market data.
    *   Use the tabs (`I Have`, `I Want`, `I Need`, etc.) to filter your view.
    *   To start a project, select checkboxes next to items in the "I Have" tab and click the **"Checkout"** button.

2.  **Projects View**:
    *   Here you'll find all the projects you've created.
    *   **Link GitHub Repo**: Click this to associate a project with a public GitHub repository. The AI can then sync the required components.
    *   **AI Kickstart**: Click this to send the project's component list to the chat assistant, asking for a detailed plan, code, and guidance.

3.  **Home Assistant View**:
    *   First, go to **Settings** and enter your Home Assistant URL and a Long-Lived Access Token.
    *   Once configured, this view will populate with all your HA entities.
    *   Click **"Link to Inventory"** on any entity card to associate it with a specific component from your stock.

4.  **Chat Assistant**:
    *   The heart of the application. Ask it anything!
    *   Examples:
        *   _"What can I build with an ESP32 and a BME280 sensor?"_
        *   _"Find me a supplier for a Raspberry Pi 5."_
        *   _"Write me a simple MicroPython script to read a DHT22 sensor."_
        *   _"I'm starting a new project to monitor my 3D printer. What components will I need?"_

5.  **Settings**:
    *   Configure your Home Assistant connection.
    *   Use the **Import/Export** functions to manage your inventory data.
